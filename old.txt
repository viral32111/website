About Me
	Hi! I'm viral32111. I'm a multi-language programmer who loves to code random things and experiment with new ideas. I'm strong in Lua, C#, PHP and Python. I also do a bit of developing here and there for servers and communities on Garry's Mod. I also map for Garry's Mod and a bit of Team Fortress 2 in Hammer, but I rarley do this anymore and I'm definetly not an expert at the software.

Programming
	Languages I would consider myself an expert in:
	• Lua
	• Python
	• C#
	• PHP
	
	Languages I've coded in a few times before, but still have things to learn:
	• JavaScript
	• Java (Specifically Node.js)
	• C++
	• VB.NET
	• HTML & CSS
	• Batch & PowerShell Script
	• SourcePawn
	
	I code Discord Bots, mainly in Python, a few in C# & Node.js, so if you need one made for a server or a friend hit me up and I'll see what I can do.
	I'm happy to help you if you've got a programming issue or you're stuck somewhere with some random half-ass error that is completley incorrect at displaying whats accually going wrong.
	I can design and code games in Unity 3D and GameMaker: Studio.
	Visual Studio is my preferred IDE when programming in C#/.NET.
	I use Sublime Text 3 to program all other languages.

Developing
	I may develop for your Garry's Mod server or Discord server if I'm feeling up for it, I have a list of rules though I'd gladly apprechiate if you followed if I am.
	• Don't randomly send me shit (messages, images) while im working.
	• Only call me if its about working, or a serious matter.
	• Don't spam me with your ideas, I will do them one by one.
	• The price I sell the work at will depend on how complicated the addon is and how long it took to code. (If it's simple its free)
	• If you ask you may join my Testing Server to see your addons progress.
	• If you wish for your addon to be on the workshop I can do that to.

Dev Past
	• I currently own my own community called Conspiracy Servers with Sandbox and Spacebuild servers. 
	• I've previously co-owned a community called LoneNetworks. (DarkRP)
	•  I've assisted A.C.E Gaming. (DarkRP)
	• I've developed for GoldenNetworks, Brother Gaming, Electrum Gaming and Redux Community. (All DarkRP)
	• Created Car Keys. (currently has 16,000+ downloads/subscriptions, 300+ thumbs up.)
	• Contributor to CAP and Spacebuild. (2 popular Garry's Mod addons)
