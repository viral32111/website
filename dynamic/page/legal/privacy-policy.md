*TO-DO*

See the [security page](/security) for more information about the physical server that the data is stored on.

## Tor

Consider using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) to access this website if you are concerned about your privacy.

The onion site address is [http://viraldwfella5we7pdbi75pmzg4bcrehcwjstyy6tgjbqhdh6pgdi6yd.onion](http://viraldwfella5we7pdbi75pmzg4bcrehcwjstyy6tgjbqhdh6pgdi6yd.onion). You should be automatically redirected to the hidden service when accessing this website in Tor Browser due to the use of the [`Onion-Location`](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/) HTTP header.

This will provide both a benefit to privacy and security as your request is designed to look identical to all other requests before being routed through a circuit of unknown nodes. This makes it impossible for this web server to identify you across sessions.
