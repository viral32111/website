Hey, I am a programmer and developer from the United Kingdom that has decent experience in nearly every major programming language, and a few various minor ones. I enjoy working on my [numerous projects](/projects), and honestly has fun coding and learning new things all-round!

I also like to play around with embedded electronics and microsystems in my free time, such as Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's, etc. Though I have not really made anything worth sharing yet, since it is still a small hobby I am actively getting better at.

My programming experience over the years has primarily been in C#, Lua, PHP, Python, JavaScript and more recently C. However, like mentioned I have pretty much dabbled with every popular language which is helpful as it makes going into a new language quite easy since the concepts are usually very similar, I just have to learn the syntax.

In case you are trying to find out information about me, I will save you the trouble and give you my online profiles below, though you are not going to find very much on them.
