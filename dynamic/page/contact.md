# Contact

*TO-DO*



If you want to get in touch with me about my projects, contracting work, to ask questions or whatever else then I would prefer you contact me [via email](mailto:contact@viral32111.com) because it is more organised and professional.

Please do not try to add me on Steam because I do not have Steam chat notifications enabled, or Discord because that is more of a personal platform for me. The only exception is if you wish to discuss anything related to my community, in that case you could join [my Discord server](/discord).

If you are privacy-minded like me, then consider encrypting your messages with [my PGP public key](/public.txt) before sending them for secure communication. Make sure to send your public key in the initial message else I will not be able to encrypt my replies!
