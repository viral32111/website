I have created, developed, maintained and published hundreds of programming and scripting projects in a wide variety of languages since I started roughly 8 years ago.</p>

I host the majority of my personal projects here as public [git repositories](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) under open-source licences in the hope that it will help other people in the future. However, most of these end up going unfinished and being abandoned shortly after starting due to lack of motivation. Sometimes though, I come back to them after a long while, and rewrite them using any new skills I have learnt, then finally finish them off.

The projects that I collaborate on with other people, have published, or have contributed to can be found on my [GitHub profile](/github), along with any public kanban boards for managing my projects.

If there is a project you have heard me discussing but it is not listed, then it means I have not got around to making it ready for the public, or it is one of the few projects I want to keep private.

Use `git clone https://viral32111.com/projects/*repository*` to clone a local repo.

This is some example code in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf( "Hello World!\n" );

	return 0;
}
```

This is some more example code in JavaScript:
```js
const myValue = 57;

function helloWorld()
	console.log( "Hello World!", myValue );
}

helloWorld();
```
