I am a programmer and developer from the United Kingdom that has valuable experience in nearly every major programming language and a constant interest in the evergrowing technology industry.

## ![Rainbow](/images/icons/rainbow.png)Hobbies

I enjoy working on personal projects in my free time, which are usually desktop applications for Windows and Linux, websites, Unity games, backend server-side infrastructure, Android applications, and game modding. Though I do still have fun taking on new projects in areas I have never explored before.

My interests are not just in software though, I am quite knowledgeable in computer hardware too. I have repaired many laptops and desktops, and built my own desktop and home server. I can give great suggestions and advice for hardware choices, and explain the rationales behind why it is ideal for the given use case.

I also like experimenting with embedded electronics and microsystems, such as Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's, etc. Though I have not made anything worth sharing yet, since it is still a small hobby that I am actively trying to get better at.

## ![Book](/images/icons/book.png)Experience

My programming experience over the last decade has been in the following languages and areas:

* C# for .NET Core & .NET Framework applications, and Unity games.
* PHP for server-side website development.
* Python for chat platform bots.
* Go for utilities & tools.
* JavaScript for websites & serverless cloud functions.
* TypeScript (Node.js) for chat platform bots.
* Java for Minecraft mods & Android applications.
* Kotlin for Android applications.
* C++ for Garry's Mod modules & 2D graphical games.
* C for low-level UEFI applications & utilities.
* HTML/CSS for website design.
* Bash & PowerShell for automation scripts.

I also have experience using or integrating with the following software suites and technologies:

* Linux, on both servers and desktops.
* MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite & Redis databases.
* Unity for game development & simulations.
* Grafana & Prometheus for system monitoring & analysis.
* Windows Server 2016, 2019 & 2022 for AD DS, AD CS, DNS, DHCP, IIS, etc.
* WSL, Hyper-V, VirtualBox & QEMU virtualisation.
* Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA & Android Studio IDEs.
* Git for version control.
* Remote dedicated & virtual private server hosting.
* Amazon Web Services, Firebase, Cloudflare Workers.
* PayPal & Stripe for payment processing.
* Apache HTTP Server & NGINX.
* Docker containers & image registries.
* SMB & NFS file shares.
* OpenVPN & WireGuard.
* ISC BIND 9 & DHCP Server.

Thanks to my many years of experience with such a large variety of languages and technologies in the computing space, I find it very easy to get started and learn new topics.
