I am a developer from the United Kingdom with a constant interest in the evergrowing technology industry and valuable experience with nearly every aspect of computing, ranging from high-level programming to low-level hardware.

My main passion resides around server-side infrastructure and network administration, I have been deploying, administrating and maintaining my own servers for nearly half a decade. This includes virtual in the cloud, unmanaged dedicated in datacenters, and on-site/at home.

## ![Rainbow](/images/icons/rainbow.png)Hobbies

I enjoy working on personal projects in my free time, usually desktop applications for Windows and Linux, websites, server-side infrastructure, Android applications, and game modding. Though, I still have fun taking on new projects in areas I have never explored before.

My interests do not remain in the software space though, as I enjoy computer hardware too. I have repaired many laptops and desktops along with having built numerous desktops and servers. I feel confident that I can give great suggestions and up-to-date advice for hardware choices, while rationalising my choices as to why it is ideal for the given scenario.

I also like experimenting with embedded electronics and microsystems, such as Arduino's, Raspberry Pi's, etc. Though I have not made anything worth sharing yet, as it is still just a hobby which I am actively trying to get better at.

My programming experience over the last decade has been in the following languages and areas:

* C# for server-side .NET Core & desktop .NET Framework applications, and Unity games.
* PHP for server-side website & RESTful API development.
* Python for chat platform bots.
* Go for utilities & tools.
* TypeScript (Node.js & Deno) for chat platform bots, full-stack websites, and serverless cloud functions.
* Java & Kotlin for Minecraft mods & Android applications.
* C++ for Garry's Mod modules & 2D graphical games.
* Lua for Garry's Mod addons & general game modding.
* C for low-level UEFI applications & utilities.
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript for client-side website design.
* Bash & PowerShell for automation scripts.

I also have experience using or integrating with the following software suites and technologies:

* MySQL/MariaDB, Redis, Neo4j, Prometheus & SQLite databases.
* Windows Server 2016, 2019 & 2022 for AD DS, AD CS, DNS, DHCP, IIS, etc.
* Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform/Firebase, Cloudflare Workers, Azure, Oracle Clouds.
* Docker container building/deployment & artifact/image registries.
* Apache HTTP Server & NGINX web servers.
* WSL, Hyper-V, VirtualBox & Proxmox (KVM) virtualisation.
* Grafana, Loki & Promtail for system monitoring/analysis.
* Git, GitHub, GitLab & Gitea for version control.
* Remote dedicated & virtual private server hosting.
* Authoritive DNS (ISC BIND) & DHCP (Kea, DNSMASQ) servers.
* Postfix email server with Dovecot IMAP, OpenDKIM signing, ClamAV scanning & Roundcube web-mail.
* OpenVPN & WireGuard site-to-site VPNs.
* PayPal & Stripe payment processing.
* Linux-based servers (Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine) & desktop environments (Ubuntu, Mint, Manjaro, Arch).
* Unity for game development & simulations.
* Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA & Android Studio IDEs.
* SMB & NFS file shares.

Thanks to my many years of experience with such a large variety of languages and technologies in computing, I find it easy learn and get started in new topics.
