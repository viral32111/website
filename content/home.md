# Home

Welcome to my personal corner of the world-wide web where I can discuss myself, showcase my projects, and highlight my achievements from over the many years I have been programming.

See the [about page](/about) for more information around who I am and what I do.

## Source

I open-sourced the code for this website in July of 2022, it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/viral32111/website) for free.

I used the repository for the development of this design, which is why it is over 2 years old despite the recent release to the public.

## History

This website has undergone dozens of redesigns, rewrites and domain changes over the five years it has been operational.

I plan for this *minimalist* design, launched at the start of 2021, to be the last major redesign of my website. Thanks to all the experience I have gained over the last few years from hosting my community forum, personal websites and University projects, I believe I have got to the point where there is no longer the warrant for a complete redesign whenever I learn a new topic in website design and development.

The inspiration behind this design stems from wanting to create a fast, minimalistic website that would work well across any device from any time. It does not require any weird CSS hacks or browser-specific selectors, nor does it violate any HTML standards. The layout is easy to manage and adapts well to new content using my on-the-fly Markdown to HTML converter.

The only exception to "*any device from any time*" is security. This web server requires clients to support TLS v1.2 or newer, EC certificates, and strong cipher suites. See the [security page](/security) for more details about the security of this website.

### Archives

The only archives of my previous designs are [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200310153357/https://viral32111.com/) (2019 to 2020) and [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180826152843/https://viral32111.com/) (2018 to 2019). Nothing of the former `viralstudios.phy.sx` and `viral32111.phy.sx` domains (2016 to 2018) was archived.

My previous design from 2019 was not ideal as it only served as a portal to my profiles. Though I did prefer the aesthetic of it compared to the design before it from 2018.
