# Donate

I appreciate all the support I get, so if you wish to spare a bit of money to help me out then thank you very much!

## Cryptocurrency

I accept Monero and Bitcoin, you can find my address [here](/xmr) for Monero, and [here](/btc) for Bitcoin.

## PayPal

I stopped accepting PayPal payments quite a while ago, and I doubt I will accept them again in the future.

## Cards

PayPal used to act as my debit & credit card processor, but since I have stopped using that, I have been working on integrating [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to process those payments.

## History

There used to be a table of donations here, but I am having issues with it. I will try to add it back as soon as I get it fixed.
