# Projects

The majority of these projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/viral32111?tab=repositories) under open-source licences in the hope that they will help other developers in the future.

There are hundreds of repositories on my account, but only a couple dozen are publicly available. I am attempting to go through them all and make them suitable for public release, but it has proven to be quite a time-consuming task.

## Showcase

My most successful project to date is my [*Car Keys*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=864523561) addon for [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/). It has over 30,000 unique visitors on the Steam Workshop page, over 22,000 current subscribers, 1,500 current favourites, and is in around 10,000 player collections.

My other two Garry's Mod addons, [*Viral's Scoreboard*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1154615469) and [*Black Hole Cache*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1300331014), are not as successful but do have roughly 2,300 current subscribers across each of them.

My favourite projects though is my [website](https://github.com/viral32111/website), [community Discord bot](https://github.com/viral32111/discordbot), [Discord relay Minecraft mod](https://github.com/viral32111/DiscordRelay), and [Twitch chat bot](https://github.com/viral32111/TwitchBot).

## Repositories

This section will eventually be updated to show a table of repositories on my self-hosted Git server.

Most of these repositories will be unaccessible as they are for private projects, the ones that are not though will be downloadable via `git clone https://viral32111.com/projects/name` without the need for authentication.
