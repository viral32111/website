# Contact

To get in touch with me about my projects, work, to ask questions, or anything else then contact me [via my email](mailto:contact@viral32111.com). Please refrain from adding me as a friend on social media or chat platforms.

If you wish to discuss something community related, then joining [our Discord server](/discord) would be best.

## Encryption

If you are familiar with PGP then consider encrypting your messages with [my PGP public key](/public.txt) for secure communication.

Remember to send your public key in your initial message so that I may encrypt my replies.
