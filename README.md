# Website

This is the client-side and most of the dynamic server-side code of my personal website.

This does ***not*** include web server configuration files responsible for some server-side behaviour and redirect links, nor does it include the statically served plain-text files ([it used to, though](https://github.com/viral32111/website/tree/97112bc0af546a18bb101ea2c216911c30ef7e76)).

## History

This repository only contains the source for the *"minimal"* version of my website on the `viral32111.com` domain (so the current one).

Any previous websites I had, including older versions of my personal ones (`viralstudios.phy.sx`, `viral32111.phy.sx`, etc.) and all of my community ones (`conspiracyservers.gaming.bz`, `conspiracyservers.co.uk`, `conspiracyservers.com`, etc.), are not available.
