Hey you, amazing visitor!

Pretty much everything on this website was created by me, viral32111!
I started this website in early 2016 with the intention of having a central hub for information about me, a place to showcase my work & projects, etc.
Over the years it has been through so many redesigns and changes to accommodate for all the new skills I've learned & projects I've started.

However, it wouldn't have been possible without these awesome people who helped me further develop it!
